Subject: Update on Q3 US RoB Project Plan

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to provide an update on the Q3 US Rhythm of Business (RoB) project plan. The sheet is still a work in progress, but I wanted to provide visibility and adhere to my updated delivery date of 12 PM today.

Thank you for your patience as we finalize the details. You can expect the start and end dates, estimated times, categorization and subtask/parent task mapping, and ownership of tasks to be updated to near completion shortly. Due to the nature of RoB, we may be adding a few tasks to the list as we identify them, but please rest assured that I will handle this task.

I kindly ask for your assistance in communicating any status updates and remarks via the project plan as they come up.

Please be on the lookout for the timeline, which will be shared on Friday, and for meeting invites to discuss RoB tasks, capacity, and knowledge transfers from Richard and me.

Thank you again for your cooperation and support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
